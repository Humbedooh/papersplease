============

A (for now) simple CFP system.

* Create events, with basic details about that event
* Events will have talk types (eg. Session, Tutorial, Keynote) which have various attributes (length, etc)
* Speakers can submit talks for consideration for an event
* Reviewers can rate a given talk, and make comments on that talk, which may or may not be sent to the speaker
* A conference chair can then approve or reject talks, based on the reviewers' ratings, or other considerations
* Talks may be assigned to a schedule (ie, a time and a room)
* Attendees (or anonymous users) may obtain a conference schedule in ics format, or may view the schedule in a variety of grid formats (per day, per track, per room)
